			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Jazz music is a cornerstone of United States culture. The invention of oppressed black citizens, it is grown and evolved into the most highly sophisticated and complex musical style in the world, and is perhaps the greatest cultural phenomenon that we have experienced in this country. Contrasting this with the current state of popular music in the U.S., and pop culture in general, shows very sharp differences in the overall quality and integrity of not only our music, but also our society. Although Charlie Parker was never exactly the Justin Timberlake of his day, the size of his contribution to the world reflected the reflected the high level of art culture of the day (most of his groundbreaking improvisations were based on contemporary compositions by composers like George Gershwin and Cole Porter, and he was a great admirer of contemporary classical composers such as Stravinsky and Bartok). Likewise, his influence was felt in all corners of the musical world by composers and players who strove to imitate his uncanny style.</p>
			<p>Jazz music has inherent qualities that encourage creativity, diligence, and unity. This article will contrast the state of contemporary pop culture, using the recent music video of the single “Can’t Remember to Forget You,” with the beginnings and influence of jazz music in America, and will demonstrate the difference in values and integrity of our culture now and then.</p>
