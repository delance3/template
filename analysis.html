			<h1>Background Analysis</h1>
			<p>The song and video for “Can’t Remember to Forget You” were released in January of 2014. While the musical quality of the song is up to the listener, the lyrics, such as “the way he makes me feel, I never seemed to act so stupid, oh here we go, he a part of me now, he a part of me” are hardly a masterpiece. They basically sum up an old story of a woman being addicted to a man who treats them badly. The composers are Shakira, Rihanna, John Hill, Tom Hull, Daniel Ledinsky, and Erik Hassle. </p>
			<p>The video  features the main artist and songwriter, Columbian born pop star Shakira, and prominent black singer Rihanna. The video lacks any formal structure, and basically consists of the two attractive women wearing a variety of scant clothing and lingerie, grinding and gyrating against walls, writhing around in bed, and erotically caressing and embracing each other. Who this video is actually intended for appears to be men ages eighteen and up, but the video is available for free to anyone who has access to the internet.</p>
			<p>There isn’t much else to say about the video. It features two prominent American pop stars who, while neither is openly gay or involved in pornography, spend the better part of 3 minutes in a musical display of lesbian-erotica. These are both women on the international stage who could be conceived of as role models for the Latino community, the black community, or even for young women of every walk of life. Instead, they openly use sex as a means to sell their image and music. The nature of this video is consistent with current pop trends: Bruno Mars’ recent single “Locked Out of Heaven” features the prominent lyric “your sex takes me to paradise,” while Robin Thicke’s recent video for “Blurred Lines” was highlighted by an abundance of topless women. Sex has been a common trademark of music videos for years. Shakira’s video for the song “She Wolf” involved basically the same themes five years ago, and the trend for overtly sexual themes in pop music can be traced back to Madonna’s “Like a Virgin” thirty years ago, and beyond.</p>
