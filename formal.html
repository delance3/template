		<h1>Contemporary Technology and Research in Jazz Music</h1>
		<p>Jazz music is a fairly new art form, and the institutionalizing of it is a fairly recent phenomenon. Like any art form, there is controversy over its origins, its purpose and significance in modern day, its integrity and crucial elements, and the proper way to teach, study, define, and catalog it. When discussing the modern ways in which todays musicians and educators use technology to conduct research and discourse, we must first understand the origins and traditional methods of teaching and practicing jazz music.</p>

		<p>	“You want to know something, you go to the source,” says Rodney Whitaker, Distinguished Professor of Bass and head of Jazz Studies at Michigan State University. “So I asked an older jazz musician, ‘how do you get started?’ And they said ‘Well, you need to learn the licks of the great masters.’ I said, ‘well, I don’t want to sound like anyone else. I want to have my own way of expressing myself.’” Dr. Ronald Carter, Professor Emeritus of Saxophone and Coordinator of Jazz Studies at Northern Illinois University, chuckles, and adds, “You really do have to imitate, learn the language, emulate, study it, become immersed in it, and then you can create from there.”  This is, in a nutshell, the traditional approach to jazz education, presented by two eminent African American educators. Rodney would cite this as a fundamentally African approach. </p>
		<p>“How did I learn rhythm?” Rodney initiates. “I asked my mom. ‘Since I can remember I could always dance, so how did I learn that?’ She said ‘It’s part of culture. Just look at how you treat your children.’ So I’m dancing with my babies when they’re little, and I’m tapping rhythm on them. That’s part of African American culture.”  The element of African culture is always present in his teachings, and in the teachings of the other professors of the Jazz Studies program. History is kept alive by oral traditions: stories, legends, fables, and songs. Music is not learned from a text or a system per se, but by imitation. </p>
		<p>“You might not remember this, but when you were a kid your way of communicating for the first two years of your life resembled your parents. You listened to them speak, you even told their jokes. You picked up on [their] language, and jazz is the same way.”</p>
		<p>Such is the way that jazz music was learned for years. Going directly to the source, via records, radio broadcasts, live performances, and lessons and apprenticeships with elder musicians, generations of musicians learned the music of Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet, Duke Ellington, Earl Hines, and other early fathers of the music. Even Armstrong was lured to the trumpet by the distinct playing of New Orleans musicians Joe “King” Oliver, Bunk Johnson, and Buddy Bolden. He recalled the encouragement and mentorship he received from Oliver, with whom he would later emerge on the scene:</p>
		<p>“Papa, Joe Oliver, God bless him, was my man. I often did errands for Stella Oliver, his wife, and Joe would give me lessons for my pay. I could not have asked for anything I wanted more. It was my ambition to play as he did. I still think that if it had not been for Joe Oliver jazz would not be what it is today. He was a creator in his own right.” </p>
		<img src="http://jalc.web.s3.amazonaws.com/press/images/008/king_oliver.jpg" height="300" width="400">
		<p>Through Oliver’s mentorship, Armstrong went on to become the single most important and influential musician in the history of jazz music. Countless other greats imparted their knowledge and wisdom to future generations. As a young musician in Detroit, Rodney, like many others, was mentored by jazz greats of the bebop era such as Donald Walden, Barry Harris, and Marcus Belgrave. This experience has deeply influenced his philosophy.</p>
		<p>“You have to be willing to give yourself to your students in terms of your time,” he says. “I have a motto [that] we’re not just their professors, we’re their mentors, and we’re going to forever be their mentors. We have to look them in the eye and be honest about where they are. We believe in being totally honest with our students,” he concludes, “because that’s how my mentors were with me.”</p>
		<p>To strictly adhere to this concept, the proper way to learn and understand jazz is from mouth to mouth. The emphasis is on the personal relationship between teacher and student, and the history of the music is passed down through anecdotes, the lessons through the examples set by the great masters of the music. Some would argue that the institutionalizing of jazz has a detrimental effect on this process. Programs such as the ones found at Berklee College of Music and the University of North Texas have gained reputations as leading institutions for jazz education. But Berklee, for example, accommodates a student body of over four thousand, with over six hundred, mostly part time or adjunct, faculty.  The question arises: is that method true to the traditional model?</p>
		<p>That is not to say that there is no place for technology or academic research in the world of jazz music. Quite the opposite. Many prominent jazz musicians and educators use online resources to their advantage. Along with their own personal websites, Facebook, Soundcloud, Myspace, and All About Jazz are websites where musicians post recordings, performance dates, booking information, and other promotional materials for the convenience of their audience. Online publishing such as this has become the predominant means for disseminating this type of information, while, similarly, digital downloads on iTunes, CD Baby, and Amazon have more or less replaced the mainstream sale of audio CDs. Jazz musicians, like members of any profession, have taken to the modern technological trends in order to create a market for themselves and their music. Likewise, educator use web resources to share ideas and materials with their students and with each other. </p>
		<p>Dr. Michael Sailors, D.M.A., has taught courses in Jazz Appreciation, Jazz Improvisation, and Jazz History, as well as ensembles, at Michigan State University and the University of Texas at Austin. His research utilizes publications such as JEN (Jazz Education Network) Magazine, and publications from the Music Educators Association. He also utilizes online forums for discussions about pedagogy, and email as a primary source of correspondence with fellow performers, teachers, and students. He doesn’t see technology as an obstacle in jazz education, but as a useful tool:</p>
		<p>“The abundance of digital media available via platforms like YouTube and Vimeo allow educators the opportunity to expose their students to a plethora of different artists. Also, devices like the IClicker allow educators to quickly evaluate students’ retention skills.” </p>
		<p>Dr. Sailors is one of many forward thinking educators who utilizes modern technology to teach students and research his field. Sarah Slonim, a New York-based pianist and educator, also uses online communication and forums as a reference for her work.</p>
		<p>“I communicate with other teachers about their experiences to improve my teaching methods, choice of learning materials, motivational tools, relationship-building with students and parents, scheduling, and pricing. Sometimes I also learn from what a student has done with a previous teacher.” Sarah holds degrees in Music Performance and Comparative Cultures and Politics. She maintains a busy performance schedule as a freelance musician and bandleader, and also teaches a studio of thirteen private students each week. Like Dr. Sailors, she incorporates technological resources into her teaching.</p>
		<p>“Some of the students' lesson books come with CD's.  The various tracks have songs that go with specific activities designed to help the students. I also use technology to share additional recordings and videos with my students.  I bring in commercial recordings of classical, jazz, and other music on my Android along with a portable speaker and listen to them with my students.  Occasionally we watch YouTube videos of well-known musicians on the phone using the portable speaker as well. I use e-mail, texts, and phone calls to communicate with my students' parents regarding scheduling, materials, and student progress.” </p>
		<p>Apart from researching recordings and direct communication, online platforms have become valuable to many jazz musicians and educators who wish to share their philosophies with the jazz community at large. Blogging has become the primary outlet for musicians to editorialize on their music, the music of others, and the state of jazz and jazz education today. Leading jazz musicians such as Wynton Marsalis, Eric Reed, and Ethan Iverson have frequently updated blogs in which they discuss their touring, review music and books, and take on educational and cultural topics. A recent article on jazz education was published on the blog of the great bassist Chuck Isreals. In his article, Isreals argues that a student must listen to the masters, and that having a strong model is essential to building technique and musicianship. He writes:</p>
    <p>“This acquisition of personal prototypes is an essential first step in the learning process. Without it, there is no foundation on which to build technique. A student can only be helped to learn to emulate an art for which the student has a clearly held image. Attempts to assimilate a more abstract process of technical practice without a sufficiently ingrained model are likely to prove frustrating, if not futile. Imitation is primary. The more highly developed the model and the more exact the imitation, the more successful will be the results.” He reinforces this argument throughout the article, while introducing his personal thoughts and philosophy.</p>
    <p>“Excessive reverence for the romantic illusion of “original thought” is the most fraudulent and destructive element in the institutionalized process of jazz education. Students are encouraged, sometimes even forced to engage in a frenzied “real time” search for “what to play”, resulting in frustration for the student and the audience. The usual result is awful gibberish which ought to be embarrassing to all parties but which seems to be not only condoned but encouraged by those jazz educators who misunderstand the process of improvisation.  </p>
    <p>“Students need to be taught to listen to how great jazz musicians perform their improvisations before their attention is directed at the improviser’s choices of what to play. What to play needs to be a “given” so that the anxiety created by the challenge of that more sophisticated element of the creative process is temporarily removed. Then the young musician can focus on developing reliable performance habits which will not be disturbed by the additional problems involved in selecting what to play. This part of the learning curve is necessarily a long one and ignoring or underestimating it can lead to discouraging and sometimes disastrous results.” </p>
    <p>Here, Israels keeps with the traditional argument that imitation of the masters is paramount to the learning process. However, rather than direct communication with a student, he is sharing his insight with a limitless number of readers. This is an advantage of online technology, where a highly acclaimed musician and educator can freely express his thoughts with the whole world, rather than the subscribers of a printed editorial publication, or just those within earshot.</p>
    <p>Perhaps the most famous blog of any prominent jazz musician is that of trumpet virtuoso Nicholas Payton. Unlike Israels’ educationally centered article, Payton’s blog deals mostly with social and cultural issues. Payton caused a major stir among jazz musicians in late 2011 with his promotion of the moniker “Black American Music,” or BAM, as a replacement for the word jazz. He caused controversy by comparing the use of the word “jazz” to that of the word “nigger,” and openly challenging and discrediting his critics and dissenters. In response to fellow trumpeter Jeremy Pelt, Payton wrote:</p>
    <img src="http://nicholaspayton.files.wordpress.com/2011/11/np_wp_header.jpg" height="300" width="500">
    <p>“I’m sure you see all these folks (mostly White) roasting your big brother over the Internet, and instead of supporting me, you brought a poker to the barbeque. White folks love to see Blacks have dissension amongst one another. It’s the first rule of colonization: divide and conquer. The correct way to do this would have been to first wait until you talked to me, but no, it was more important for you to put your brother on blast on your blog.</p>
    <p>“Isn’t it enough that you’ve co-opted my style of dress, trumpet sound and lines, certain compositional devices. Plus you hit my manager up for representation. Now, you’re trying to jack my Internet hustle?” </p>
    <p>Payton’s brazen, firebrand writing style is a great example of the use of the web as a public forum for thought and expression, and while his opinions have proven to be polarizing, he nonetheless has made himself heard on social issues surrounding jazz. Recently, he wrote on a New York Daily News article entitled: “<i>Jazz saxophonist Robert Vineberg, arrested for heroin dealing in Philip Seymour Hoffman net, has A-list recording credits</i>.” The article cites Charlie Parker, Joe Guy, and Billie Holiday as prominent jazz musicians with significant ties to drug use. Payton takes issue with the pretense of Jazz and heroin use being linked, writing:</p>
    <p>“Jazz? How did the narrative get twisted from one about a deceased actor with an addiction, to one about Jazz?</p>
    <p>“Why evoke the names of 3 Black musicians who passed on over half a century ago to tell your story about a White drug dealer and abuser with whom they share little to no association? Did Black people or Jazz musicians invent heroin? Were Blacks the first to do it or bring it into America?</p>
    <p>“More insightful is how Bird and Billie are posthumously dragged into this story about Robert “Aaron,” when he worked with Blondie, David Bowie and Mick Jagger — 3 Hall of Famers with known histories of addiction. This story conveniently makes no connection to the proliferation of drugs and drug-related deaths in Rock culture.</p>
    <p>“And none of this I’m writing is an attack or a judgement on drug use, but rather, an observation on how stories are spun.</p>
    <p>“With all due respect to Mr. Hoffman, why is it when he overdoses the NYPD is turning NYC upside-down to find someone to blame, but when Whitney Houston OD’ed, she was just another Black junkie musician?” </p>
    <p>Payton demonstrates one extreme of online forums and publications. Mainstream trade publications have also turned to the web to reach a wider and more diverse audience. Popular magazines such as DownBeat and JazzTimes provide reviews of new albums, artist profiles and news about musicians and their projects, and advertising for everything from instrument makers, clubs, festivals, universities, and camps. One example of a common article from a trade publication comes from DownBeat, detailing pianist/ vocalist Diana Krall’s current tour. The article offers details about Krall’s touring schedule and some unassuming plugs for her and her new album:</p>
    <img src="http://www.downbeat.com/photos/magazinecovers/201404Cover.jpg" height="400" width="210">
    <p>“On April 4, Krall will continue the journey. With her stellar band—guitarist Aram Bajakian, bassist Dennis Crouch, fiddler-guitarist Stuart Duncan, drummer Karriem Riggins and keyboardist Patrick Warren—she has announced the remaining 10 concert dates of her “Glad Rag Doll” world tour.</p>
    <p>“Glad Rag Doll was inspired by early 20th-century source material, which Krall heard as a child from her father’s record collection. The album was produced by T Bone Burnett and features a mix of jazz, rock and blues.</p>
    <p>“In 2013, Krall won the Female Vocalist category in the DownBeat Readers Poll. (She has topped that category for seven consecutive years.)” </p>
    <p>These types of publications also typically offer reprinted interviews and articles with historically important musicians from older issues, blindfold tests from prominent contemporary artists, and editorials and letters about educational concepts or musical analysis. </p>
    <p>While the most important element of music performance and education remains the study of music, history, and tradition, the use of modern technology to research, communicate, and publish work in the field of music have stayed constant with the evolution of internet and wireless technology. Professionals in music, as in all fields, will no doubt continue to find ways to take advantage of new technologies while retaining the necessities of the art form. Personal mentorship and attention to the history of music have remained and will likely continue to remain cornerstones of jazz education and public dialogue.</p>
