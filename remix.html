			<p>The issue that we chose for this project was based on various studies and statistical information. Compositionally, therefore, composing the script tended to be very straightforward, with lots of references to said statistics. Composing on this issue gave me insight into the history and facts about smartphones and their users, which is a topic about which my knowledge was limited. The organization of the documentary consisted of simply piecing together the ideas each member formulated in a cohesive and logical way. The overall format was designed to be accessible to an audience.</p>
			<p>The topic was chosen based on a previously written paper by a group member. While the process in itself was enjoyable, the most challenging aspect, as with all group activities, was finding time around each participants schedule to devote to meeting and working together. Certain parts of the project were, in a sense, cumulative, because each member found time to work on their own and introduce their ideas to the project.</p>
			<p>The primary research resource was the internet, which has natural convenience and a vast amount of information. However, I was surprised at the difficulty in locating specific statistics and information that this project required.</p>
			<p>The group was very cooperative and receptive to ideas. Working together was a relatively easy process. I feel that this project would have not been difficult were it individually assigned, but having four people pulling resources definitely eased the burden of work for all parties.</p>
			<p>The project was fairly simple and required little planning. Our first meeting consisted of creating a basic outline and a few key ideas, and the project took form from there. With more time, it may have been possible to conduct more detailed interviews, and to acquire better equipment and shoot more elaborate footage.</p>
			<p>The visual aspect of the documentary is the shifting between Stevenâ€™s narration and narrations from other group members accompanied by demonstrative videos. I think this is effective because it gives the audience a sense of familiarity with Steven while also providing informative facts. The group decided that a simple design was acceptable and appropriate for the mood of the video.</p>
