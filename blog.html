			<p>In class today we viewed the South Park Episode “Make Love, Not Warcraft.” I am a fan of this show, and I have seen this episode many times. In fact, I remember seeing it for the first time before I fully understood anything about South Park, and before I knew anything about the game “World of Warcraft.” It’s apparent after seeing this episode that it is a very bracing primer for both the show and the game.</p>
			<p>	South Park has generally been geared toward young adults and teenagers. Early staples of the show were excessive violence and obscenity, contrasted by primitive animation and underage characters. The format of the show appeals to a subversive sense of humor in the same way that “The Simpsons” did for over a decade. Over time, the show has evolved from simply lampooning celebrities and creating absurd situations to a sharp satire of pop culture. The clear victim of this episode is the World of Warcraft community.</p>
			<p>	This episode is unique in the way that it examines the World of Warcraft and its gamers. The episode makes many tongue in cheek statements about the silliness of the game, suggesting that people with World of Warcraft accounts have “no life,” and very specifically parodies users who spend too much time playing without engaging in social activities, or indeed a healthy lifestyle. At the same time, much of the episode gives way to World of Warcraft animation, and openly acknowledges the mania that the game created. In a way, the episode comes off as something of a tribute to the game and its creators.</p>
			<p>While much of the episode is carried forward by classic South Park humor (parody, absurdity, gross out), the episode can clearly be summed up by the view that dedicating too much time to a video game, among other activities, has a detrimental effect on social relationships, physical health, and, in some cases, mental health. </p>
