			<h1>Proposed Solution</h1>
			<p>There is no simple solution for the issue of a decaying culture. The history of jazz music offers insight into what a culture can accomplish with good work ethic and values, and the prevailing of basic human decency and equality over issues of racism and segregation. The state of popular culture now reflects the lack of inherent morals and values in our current society.</p>
			<p>Since the heyday of jazz music, the population of the United States has become larger and more diverse. As a result, the music industry has grown, and has sought ways to sell its products to the most people. The lowest common denominator of most people is sex, and that has become a useful tool for, not just the music industry, but all industries to move merchandise. While it is true that much early New Orleans jazz was coupled with prostitution, and the Jazz Age was set against the backdrop of Prohibition, and the thriving jazz of Kansas City in the 1930’s was in the midst of a totally corrupt infrastructure, jazz music never fell to the level of its sleazy environs. Jazz musicians understood, acknowledged, accepted, parodied, and even partook in the culture of drugs and sex, but as musicians, they artfully incorporated their impressions of such things into the bigger picture of their music, and focused on bigger themes such as life, love, and freedom. </p>
			<p>The result of the integrity and dedication of the black jazz musicians was that they became leading figures in desegregating the United States, and they left a huge legacy of brilliant music. In contrast, black role models in pop music today are men and women, with some exceptions, embrace a culture of drugs, sex, and gang life. There are distinguished black men and women in many fields, but the fact is that what is marketed to young people, as well as the rest of us, is the simple formula “sex sells.”</p>
			<p>The only way to counter the effects of this crumbling of art and culture is to inject a sense of integrity into young generations of Americans. Young people must see the results of hard work and learn to value it.  Jazz music and other high quality music and art, not to mention other vocations, can be useful tools in demonstrating this and inspiring future generations of innovators and geniuses. </p>
			<p>The best way of introducing jazz to young people is simply to take it to them. I have personally been involved with several programs, including Jazz at Lincoln Center, that present jazz music to school assemblies. In these programs, musicians use jazz to demonstrate many ideas: their instruments and their role in a band, how jazz music relates to history and the world, or larger concepts such as working together, listening to each other, and using life skills and fundamental ideas that we learn in school. Musicians who care about jazz will benefit by keeping the tradition alive and bringing interest to new generations.</p>
