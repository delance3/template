		<h1>The Double Bass</h1>
		<p>The major I have chosen at MSU is Music Performance with an emphasis in Jazz Studies. I decided on a career in music during my junior year of high school, and have been actively studying and performing music for several years. In the Jazz Studies program, students work in class on music theory and musicianship concepts. The curriculum also includes an emphasis on performance, with students participating in several performing ensembles, and participating in national and international tours and community performances and outreach.</p>
		<p>As a professional musician, I have had numerous experiences that have influenced my attitude toward the profession. In general, the main attraction for me comes from the people I have worked with, many of whom have become close friends. As in any field, sharing similar interests and passions with others opens doorways toward close relationships, and I have come to form close friends with people from every corner of the United States, and from many walks of life: African Americans, Jewish Americans, Latino Americans, musicians abroad from Japan, Israel, South America, Canada, Greece, Italy, Russia, Serbia, Australia, and many others.</p>
		<p>	Apart from friendships gained and knowledge acquired from interacting with such a diverse community, there is nothing that compares with the feelings of euphoria and excitement that come from great performances with great musicians. I have found that being on stage and indulging in the art of performing music with musicians who are deeply dedicated to and passionate about music, jazz in particular, creates a sense of completeness and, in many cases, awe. Getting into a really good groove on the bandstand is comparable to being on a great football team that executes its plays seamlessly and dominates its opposition. You feel unstoppable, and you share in that feeling with your comrades.</p>
		<p>   	The most important piece of technology that has led to my decision is my instrument, the upright bass. My first experiences with the upright bass were mostly hearing it on recordings (an early example being Fred Marsh on "A Charlie Brown Christmas" by Vince Guaraldi ), and seeing various performances of local jazz and bluegrass musicians. My parents purchased my first instrument while I was in the sixth grade, and I subsequently began classical bass lessons.</p>
		<p>      All instruments, acoustic or electric, are built on acoustic principals. Because of its large size, the upright bass is a good example of acoustic construction. It is a member of the string group of instruments, as opposed to wind or percussion, and is made primarily of wood, as opposed to brass. The bass typically stands at or just over six feet tall. The body of the instrument is a hollow chamber, with a top, back, and sides, each carved to shape. Two f holes are carved into the top plate, from which sound emits. The body is glued to a protruding neck, affixed with a scrolled headstock and a fingerboard, usually made of ebony.</p>
		<p>                Mechanically, the bass works the same as other members of the violin family, except that an adjustable pin is attached to the base of the instrument to accommodate a player's height. A tailpiece is bound to the endpin, and a wooden bridge sits on the top of the instrument. The instrument's four strings attach to the tailpiece and are guided over the bridge, up the fingerboard and into the headstock, where they are wound and tightened by tuning mechanisms. While the wooden elements are glued together, the string system is held in place entirely by tension.</p>
		<p>                The strings of the instrument are usually constructed of metal, and each string is tempered to a specific tension. The tension of the strings on the body are supported by a long bass bar that is glued under the bass side of the top, and a wooden dow, known as the sound post, which braces the top and the back on the treble side. The strings are set into motion by plucking with the fingers of the right hand, or drawing a bow across to sustain the vibration. The pitch of the bass is changed by stopping the strings against the fingerboard with the fingers of the left hand. Shortening the strings raise the pitch, while lengthening the strings lowers the pitch.</p>
		<p>                A hybrid of the violin family and the now-archaic viol da gamba, the bass is tuned in intervals of perfect fourths, to the pitches E1, A1, D2, and G2. The bass's large body and strings are designed to accommodate the extremely low pitches, and it is generally among the lowest sounding instruments in any ensemble. The role of the instrument in most styles of music is to provide the bass line, which acts as the harmonic support of the band. Indeed, its earliest use was to augment the low end capabilities of the string section of an orchestra (violins, violas, cellos etc.). While this role can be performed by a variety of instruments, such as the bass guitar, tuba, sousaphone, or organ, the upright bass is the common bass instrument in classical, jazz, bluegrass, and other mostly acoustic styles of music.</p>
		<p>	While large and unwieldy, the upright bass has great allure. Its shape is robust, yet elegant. The sound of the bass is profound; the thumping of the strings hits you right in your chest, like a great bass drum, and the deep, dark resonating tones encircle you like a big, comfortable cushion of sound. To see a master of the bass play, such as Gary Karr, Edgar Meyer, Charles Mingus, Paul Chambers, Ron Carter, Ray Brown, Christian McBride, or Rodney Whitaker, is to see the uncanny combination of power and grace. </p>
		<p>Because of its large size and scale, the upright bass has proven to be a difficult instrument to master. The simple depression of the strings with the left hand requires a building of strength and stamina, and bassists work for years to achieve great agility and independence of the fingers. Likewise, the low sound of the bass does not come easily. Sound production is among the most difficult aspects of the instrument, and, whether arco (with the bow) or pizzicato (with the fingers), it takes hours of long tones and sound exercises, day after day, month after month, year after year, to achieve a consistent, audible, beautiful sound. That is not to mention the task of navigating the fingerboard, learning the proper positions and techniques in order to play the bass in tune and with a sense of musicality. It should be easy to see, given the arduous task of learning just the fundamentals of the bass, how appealing it is to be among the great bassists who not only command the instrument, but also deliver a unique musical experience with it. The masters of the bass convey a great freedom of expression, while at the same time they lay down a beat that makes you want to dance, jump, and sometimes shout with joy.</p>
		<p>To summarize, the bass, its history, and its workings are fascinating to me, and the role of the bassist as the very musical foundation of the band is a role that I embrace and cherish. The challenging aspects of mastering the instrument are rewarding, and exemplify the virtues of dedication, discipline, and humility. The most appealing part of the instrument, however, is the satisfaction of bringing joy and stimulation to an audience, and the possibility of reaching out and touching people through music is a goal that I have every time I pick up the bass.</p>
