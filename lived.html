		<h1>The Double Bass</h1>
		<p>The major I have chosen at MSU is Music Performance with an emphasis in Jazz Studies. I decided on a career in music during my junior year of high school, and have been actively studying and performing music for several years. In the Jazz Studies program, students work in class on music theory and musicianship concepts. The curriculum also includes an emphasis on performance, with students participating in several performing ensembles, and participating in national and international tours and community performances and outreach.</p>
