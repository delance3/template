			<h1>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
			<p>This course offers a unique opportunity. Not only is it focused on developmental writing for students in the academic, editorial, and social contexts, but it also provides fundamental training for internet design and programming. Beyond this, it combines the two theses into practical use, giving the student plenty of opportunities to practice literacy on the written page and on the web-page. The main exercise of this course was through the dissertation of four major projects, namely a “Lived Experience Project,” a “Cultural Analysis Proposal,” a “Formal Research Project,” and a collaborative “Remix Project Proposal,” accompanied by a short video documentary. The nature of the assignments, while detailed in structure and requisites, tended to leave much open space in terms of topic and examination, which is very beneficial to the student. This process lays out the fundamentals for proper writing and research, while giving the student freedom of interest and creativity in composing. As a music major at Michigan State University, my topics included researching my instrument (the double bass), contrasting the culture of music today with the height of the jazz era, the role of technology and research in jazz music, and the effects of smartphone overuse on society as a whole, which was a topic that I was widely uneducated on prior. These subjects naturally appealed to me, and while researching them was rewarding and enjoyable, the guidelines provided for the formal writing process provided discipline and attention to my research methods and the way I was able to present my findings.
			</p>
			<p>Of course, each project provided a unique challenge. The “Lived Experience” project instructed: “Identify an academic and/or professional career track for yourself.  Identify and describe one piece of technology that has led you to your chosen field. Describe in detail the experiences with technology that relate to your chosen major or field.” Naturally, as a music major and a professional musician for nearly ten years, I had an easy time declaring my career path, and once I justified the double bass as a significant piece of technology in my field, I was on my way. The first objective was to research the instrument itself and provide the background on the issue. But the nature of the project persuaded me to go into my own history and realize the course of events that led me into this field and to examine my whole relationship, physical, mental, and emotional, with the bass and with my career in music. I believe this is an excellent way for any student to make introspective discoveries, and, since most students don’t decide on a career as early as I happened to, make real observations about themselves and what it is that they value and hope to accomplish in life.</p>
			<p>The “Cultural Analysis Proposal” proved a bit more challenging. The most difficult aspect of this project was to decide on a topic. Once again, I turned to music. But this time, rather than speaking from my personal experiences, I assumed the role of an observer of history and of contemporary culture. Upon consideration of the state of pop music, I found myself at odds with the dynamics of the music industry and their exploitation of, among other things, sexuality, particularly of young people. Once I had collected my thoughts and aligned my position, I found that a good way of expressing my differences with the state of music was to contrast it against the accomplishments of the jazz musicians of the twentieth century, whom I have studied for years. Again, introspection proved fruitful in my discourse, as this time I was able to summarize my feelings with evidence from history, and present a collection of values and principles that I felt was substantiated by my research. This project taught my less about my personal history, but more about my own beliefs and where they exist in the present.</p>
			<p>The “Formal Research Project” proved more challenging still. As I turned again to my roots in jazz music, the subject of jazz education arose quite logically, but in this case the amount of work required by the project seemed a bit daunting. In examining the role that research and modern technology play in jazz education, I decided to use the main source of modern technology available: the internet. I found that my research subjects, professional musicians and educators alike, use avail themselves of the internet quite often. As I began, I realized again the contrast between history and the present: while jazz education has long been an oral and aural tradition, as is the African custom, today the use of electronics and web browsing has made information widely available to anyone who wishes to observe it. While this did not become as introspective as the former projects, it was yet another chance to educate myself on the history of my profession and the inherent traditions and values thereof, and to examine modern conveniences, trends, and technologies that are mainstream to new members of the profession. </p>
			<p>The “Remix” project was perhaps the most enjoyable. Not only did this project offer opportunities to work with and exchange ideas with other students, but it introduced the new medium of video and audio recording. Unlike the prior assignments, this topic was totally unrelated to music, which provided me with the challenge of researching and understanding a more or less foreign topic: the overuse of smartphones and its effects. Producing a documentary was a totally new experience for me, and I was charged with the tasks of collecting interviews and recording audio commentary. I found both of these activities to be enjoyable, although new, and the project provided me with insight and respect into a whole new medium. </p>
			<p>The parallel objective to all of these projects is web literacy. The curriculum for this course is supplemented with tutorials and educational tracks on webpage design and “.html” language. This was a subject that was completely new to me, and while I would still consider myself a novice at the business of webpage construction, I have gained valuable insight into the science and the art of what goes into making a webpage function, and into the importance of design, layout, and accessibility to any given website and its patrons. In principle, this aspect of the class is what makes it so unique, as well as beneficial. Not only is it a writing class that studies the field of science and technology, but it gives the students practical experience in the fields of both writing and science and technology. Not only that, but it focuses on possibly the most important aspect of science and technology as a basis for the student’s education: the World Wide Web. The web has offered to those of our era an international platform for the instantaneous exchange of information, ideas, and goods and services, something which no previous era ever dreamed of. Use of the internet is vital in modern life, and the ability to effectively navigate and utilize it is a skill that has proven to be valuable in our time and will continue to show its value in every imaginable field for years to come.</p>
			<p>On the course website (http://cdaniels75.github.io/wra110/index.html), the mission of this class was stated that students should “view themselves as contributing members of MSU’s community of scholars, committed to asking important questions and to seeking rich responses to those questions, and developing skills, knowledge, and attitudes that improve the quality of life for self and others through scholarly, social, and professional activities.” </p>
			<p>The wording of the last section seems rather lofty, but in reality, is something that can be reasonably achieved through study of this course. One thing that I noted in my researching, particularly for the previously mentioned “Cultural Analysis Proposal,” is that contemporary culture is rather lazy and, in many ways, inept. Reading current periodicals and editorials, now commonly in the form of “blogs,” usually amounts to tripe. The lack of eloquence, sophistication, and basic grammar – sometimes omitted for effect, sometimes not – is a signal that culture is on a decline. Not only is the poor literary element troubling, but the gross overuse of hyperbole and vulgar language has become a pandemic in modern writing, and most authors who employ such tactics have surrendered their credibility as effective writers, whether in journalism, criticism, or opinion editorials. I don’t know what it is that has caused this drop in quality, but the remedy seems clear, and is pointedly included right in the course description: students should “[develop] skills, knowledge, and attitudes that improve the quality of life for self and others through scholarly, social, and professional activities.” Skills such as fluid and interesting writing and editorializing. Knowledge of facts and proper fundamentals and techniques, no matter what a person’s vocation may be. Attitudes, such as the unwillingness to accept mediocrity and immorality, the belief in discipline and a strong work ethic, and the desire to excel and influence others through our excellence. The development of these ideals is the means by which the quality of life, community, and society may be improved. </p>
