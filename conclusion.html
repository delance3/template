				<h1>Conclusion</h1>
				<p>The struggles and integrity of the black jazz musicians of the early to mid-20th century are obvious. The level of their artistic achievements speaks for itself, and to put that in the context of post-reconstruction Jim Crow culture in the south and racial discrimination around much of the rest of the country, the feats that these musicians accomplished are somewhat mind-boggling. The level of ingenuity of these musicians represents the values and character that blacks, along with most of the rest of the U.S., shared in that era. They believed in hard work and dedication, and in the freedom and opportunity that was available in the United States, and they fought like hell to enjoy it. </p>
				<p>Contrast that now to not just the Black American community, but the whole of American culture today. The things that are celebrated are nihilism and hedonism. The values that are represented by pop culture are sex and drugs. As we have seen, sex is what is being used to sell music today, and there is more and more activism in constructing new norms for this type of lifestyle. A reverse cultural shift is the one way to counter the negative effects of the entertainment industry on society but it is not likely to happen given the politicizing of every issue that arises in the country today. If we look to the quality music of the great jazz musicians and the sacrifices that they made, it would teach our whole country a valuable lesson.</p>
