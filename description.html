				<h1>Description of the Issue</h1>
				<p>Jazz music has always appealed to a wide variety of people. From the earliest days of jazz, it became a sensation that drove the imaginations of listeners with exciting, virtuoso performers and infectious syncopated rhythms. During a time when radio was the premier form of entertainment in the United States, jazz music became a national phenomenon with audiences across the country, and new bands, dances, and songs were marketed relentlessly by the music industry. The 1920’s, preceding the Great Depression, became the aptly named Jazz Age. It was an era of (temporary) prosperity for the U.S. and the exciting rhythms of jazz brought people out to the party.</p>
				<p>While white bands where generally marketed by the predominantly white music industry (the first band to officially record jazz was the all-white New Orleans group, the Original Dixieland Jass Band in 1917 ), jazz is a mostly black music that was invented by black musicians. It has roots in spirituals and hymns, as well as native African and Caribbean rhythms, Ragtime (a classical piano style pioneered by composer Scott Joplin and other black composers), and the African-American cultivated “blues.” Most of the most important early innovators of Jazz music were of African descent, including saxophonists Sidney Bechet and Coleman Hawkins, Creole pianist and composer Jelly Roll Morton, pianist and composer Duke Ellington, and the famous trumpeter Louis Armstrong, whose career spanned five decades. Black musicians created their own sound, original compositions, and mixed the intellectually, soulful, and danceable elements of music as had never been done before. Although white bands were pushed into the spotlight (such as the so-called “King of Jazz” Paul Whiteman, and later swing bands such as the Benny Goodman and Glenn Miller Orchestras), the influence of blacks in jazz could never be denied, and integration in the music became inevitable.</p>
				<p>As jazz reached its pinnacle of popularity during the Swing and Big Band eras of the 1930’s and 1940’s, musicians began to integrate on the national scene. Clarinetist Benny Goodman, billed as the “King of Swing” and arguably the most popular bandleader of his era, became one of the first white musicians to do so by adding black virtuoso soloists to his band: pianist Teddy Wilson in 1935, vibraphonist Lionel Hampton in 1936, and guitarist Charlie Christian in 1939.  As musicians such as saxophonist Charlie Parker, pianist Thelonious Monk, and trumpeters Dizzy Gillespie and Miles Davis continued to make artistic progress, more and more of them were seen as the geniuses of the music, and more and more black and white musicians joined together on the bandstand. Prominent black musicians also became vocal in the Civil Rights Movement. While Duke Ellington had composed pieces such as “Black and Tan Fantasy”  and “Black, Brown and Beige”  in tribute of the Black American race and their struggles, musical leaders such as bassist Charles Mingus and drummer Max Roach asserted their frustration with such titles as “Fables of Faubus”  and the “Freedom Now Suite.”  Black musicians became role models in the black community, and the efforts they made led to greater mainstream popularity and success for artists such as Michael Jackson, Whitney Houston, Prince, and many others.</p>
